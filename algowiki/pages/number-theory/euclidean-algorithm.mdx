# Greatest Common Divisor

Greatest Common Divisor or commonly known as `gcd` of two integers is greatest common integer that completely divides both of them.

$
\gcd(a,\,b) = \max{d \in \mathbb{Z}^+ : d\,|\,a \text{ and } d\,|\,b}
$

$d\,|\,a$ `means d divides a`

$gcd(0,\, a) = a$ <br />
$gcd(0,\, 0) = undefined$ <br />

## Euclidean Algorithm

- Problem :- Find $gcd(a,\, b)$ <br />
  Naive way of doing this would be to just iterate over all integers in reverse order until you find an integer that divides both $a$ and $b$. <br />
  `Time complexity` - $O(min(a,\, b))$ <br /> <br />

- Intuition behind `Euclidean Algorithm` to solve this problem efficiently <br /><br />
  Let's say $d$ is some integer that divides both $a$ and $b$. Then we can prove $d$ also divides $a - b$. <br />
  `Proof -` <br /> $(a - b) \,\% \,d = ((a \,\%\, d) - (b \,\%\, d) + d) \,\%\,d$ <br />
  $(a - b) \,\% \,d = (0 - 0 + d) \,\%\,d \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\because a \,\%\, d = 0\, \, \,b \, \%\, d = 0$ <br />
  $\therefore (a - b) \,\% \,d = d\,\%\,d = 0 \,\blacksquare$ <br /><br />
  Let's build further intuition on this `proof`. Let $a$ be represented as $(b * q) + r \, \mid$ $q$ is $quotient$ and $r$ is $remainder$.<br />
  Now we can prove that $d$ also divides $r$. Here is the `proof`<br />

  - $a = (b * q) + r$ <br />
  - $a\,\%\,d = ((b * q) + r)\,\%\,d$ <br />

  - $0 = ((b * q) + r)\,\%\,d \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\because a\,\%\,d = 0$ <br />
  - $((b * q) + r)\,\%\,d = ((b * q)\%\,d) + (r\,\%\,d) = 0$ <br />
  - $((b * q)\%\,d) + (r\,\%\,d) = (((b\,\%\,d) * (q\,\%\,d)) + (r\,\%\,d) = 0$ <br />
  - $((b * q)\%\,d) + (r\,\%\,d) = ((0 * (q\,\%\,d)) + (r\,\%\,d)) = 0 \because (b\,\%\,d = 0)$ <br />
  - $(0 + (r\,\%\,d)) = (r\,\%\,d) = 0 \,\blacksquare$

    Let's see why this helps : <br />
    If a number divides both $a$ and $b$
    then it must also divide $r$ because $(r = a - (b * q))$ <br />
    So $gcd(a, \,b) = gcd(b,\,r)$

  - `Example`

    - Let's see a concrete example with $48$ and $18$:
    - $48 = 18 * 2 + 12$ (First divide $48$ by $18$)
    - $18 = 12 * 1 + 6$ (Then divide $18$ by $12$)
    - $12 = 6 Ã— 2 + 0$ (Finally divide $12$ by $6$)
    - At each step, we're reducing the problem to finding gcd of smaller numbers <br /> $GCD(48,18) = GCD(18,12) = GCD(12,6) = 6$ <br /><br />

      `Why this algorithm works ?`

    - Each remainder is strictly smaller than the previous divisor
    - The remainders keep getting smaller
    - They can't go below zero
    - So the process must eventually terminate when we get remainder $0$
    - The last non-zero remainder is our gcd

### Recursive Definition (Euclidean Algorithm)

- $
  \gcd(a,b) =
  \begin{cases}
  |a| & \text{when } b = 0 \,;\,
  \gcd(b, a \bmod b) & \text{when } b \neq 0
  \end{cases}
  $

```java gcd.java {2} copy
static int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b , a % b);
}
```

- `Time Complexity` $O(log_2(max(a,\, b)))$
