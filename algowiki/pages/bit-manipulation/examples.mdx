# Examples of Bit Manipulation

## How to check if a number is power of 2 ?

- Naive way is to keep dividing it by $2$ if it is even and if we end up with $1$ it is power of $2$ otherwise it's not.

```java filename="demo.java" copy
boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    if(n == 0)
        return false;
    else {
        while(n % 2 == 0) n /= 2;
        return (n == 1);
    }
}
```

Time complexity of the above code is $$O(log_2n)$$.

- Here is a clever trick to solve it in constant time $$O(1)$$. <br />
  - Consider a number $$n$$ which is power of $2$ which means $n = 2 ^ j$ for some $j$ <br /> It is obvious that $n$ will have only $j^{\text{th}}$
    bit equal to $1$, all the remaining bits will be $0$ <br />
  - Now think about $$(n - 1)$$, it will be have $k^{\text{th}}$ bit equal to $1$ if $k < j$. <br />
  - In simpler words $$(n - 1)$$ will have all the bits as 1 after $j^{\text{th}}$ bit.
  - Consider $n = 32$ <br />
    $32 = 00100000_2$ <br />
    $31 = 00011111_2$ <br />
    $32 \, \& \, 31 = 00000000_2$<br />
  - This can be generalized to any $n$ which is power of $2$ i.e $n = 2 ^ j$
  - $\boxed{
        n \text{ is a power of 2 iff : \, }
        n \, \& \, (n - 1) = 0 \, \text{and} \, n\,!= 0}$

```java filename="demo.java" copy
boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    if(n == 0)
        return false;
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0
}
```

## How to check if certain bit at position is set in a number

We can use combination of Logical **AND** and Left shift operator **&lt;&lt;**

<br /> Notice that $2 ^ i$ can be written as $1 << i$ and if $i^{\text{th}}$ bit of $n$ is $0$ then $n * (1 << i) = 0$ <br />

> **Note:** <a href='https://gaelfoppolo.com/bit-masks-as-feature-flags/' target="_blank"><u>This is widely used in modern SDLC for feature toggle in deployments to check if certain feature is enabled or not</u></a>

```java filename="demo.java" copy
boolean checkIfIthBitIsSet(int n, int i) {
    return ((n & (1 << i)) != 0);
}
```

## Generate all possible subsets of a set

We can use bitmasking to solve this problem. <br />
Consider a set $\{ x, y, z \}$ of three elements. We can iterate over all possible binary masks of length $3$ <br />
We will be picking $i^{\text{th}}$ element from original set if current bit mask has $i^{\text{th}}$ bit set.

- $000_2 = \{\}$
- $001_2 = \{z\}$
- $010_2 = \{y\}$
- $011_2 = \{y,z\}$
- $100_2 = \{x\}$
- $101_2 = \{x,z\}$
- $110_2 = \{x,y\}$
- $111_2 = \{x,y,z\}$

```java filename="demo.java" copy
// Function to generate all possible subsets using bit manipulation
public static List<List<Integer>> generateSubsets(int[] set) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int n = set.length;
    // There are 2^n subsets for a set of size n
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {  // Loop through all 2^n possible subsets
        List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Check if the j-th bit of i is set (1)
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                subset.add(set[j]);
            }
        }
        result.add(subset);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Few more tricks with bit manipulation

- Return rightmost $1$ bit or $MSB$ in $n$ <br />
  $$
  n \, \& \, (n - 1)
  $$
- Set $i^{\text{th}}$ bit to $1$ in $n$ <br />
  $$
  n \mid (1 << i)
  $$
- Toggle $i^{\text{th}}$ bit in $n$ <br />
  $$
  n \oplus (1 << i)
  $$
- Count set bits in a integer $(Keringham \,Algorithm)$

```java filename="demo.java" copy
// Number of iterations in this loop is equal to number of set bits
public static int countSetBits(int x) {
    int count = 0;
    while (x > 0) {
        count += 1;
        x &= (x - 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

- Swapping two numbers without temporary variable

  $$
  a = a \oplus b \\
  b = a \oplus b \\
  a = a \oplus b
  $$

- Rotate bits by $k$ number of bit positions

  - Left Rotate
    $$
      (num << k) \,|\, (num >> (n - k))
    $$
  - Right Rotate
    $$
      (num >> k) \,|\, (num << (n - k))
    $$

- Unique element in the array : If all the integers appear twice except for one integer, we can `XOR` all the integers to get unique integer

## Practical Applications

1. **Efficient Storage**:
   - Use bits to represent flags or states compactly (e.g., _feature toggles_, _permissions_).
2. **Boolean Matrix Operations**
   - Represent rows/columns as bitmasks for fast bitwise operations.
3. **Dynamic Programming with BitMasking**
   - Solve combinatorial problems efficiently, such as `traveling salesman`, `subset-sum`, etc.
4. **Optimize Arithmetic Operations**
   - Use shifts for multiplication/division by powers of two.
5. **Hashing**
