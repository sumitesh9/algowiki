# Introduction

A function calling itself is called `Recursion`. <br />
Example :

```java filename="recursion.java" {3} copy
void hello() {
    System.out.println("Hello");
    hello(); // This is recursive call
}
```

## When to use it ?

Recursion is usually applied to problems which can be broken down into smaller subproblems. <br />
Example : Find factorial of a number

Factorial of a positive number $n$ is defined as :

$$
    n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) .... * 1
$$

### Base case

Base case is the condition that `stops` the recursion. Usually it is the condition for which result is already known.
$n = 0$ is the base case for the factorial problem where we already know the answer as $1$

### Recursive case

The recursive case in recursion is the part of the function that reduces the problem into smaller subproblems and makes a recursive call to solve these subproblems. It's the part of the function where the function calls itself, typically with different parameters, until it eventually reaches the base case.

$$
\text{factorial}(n) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } n = 0 \\
n * \text{factorial}(n - 1) & \text{if } n > 0
\end{cases}
$$

```java filename="factorial.java" {3} copy
int factorial(int x) {
    if (x == 0) return 1; // Base condition
    return x * factorial(x - 1); // Recursive call
}
```
